# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to visually show earthquake data on a map.

## Approach
I used JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve GeoJSON data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to gather data regarding earthquakes and tectonic plate data to map. With the Leaflet library, I plotted earthquake and tectonic plate data on a Mapbox map through an API request, allowing for interactivity with the data on the map.
